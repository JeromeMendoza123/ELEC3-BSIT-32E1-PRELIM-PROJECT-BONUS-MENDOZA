        <p>
            My current reflection in this subject is that both backend and frontend aint that simple as it seems to be.
            Since both has more things to setup and do like making sure the data you insert goes through its database
            and also do some testings in using Postman like the GET, POST, PUT AND DELETE.
        </p>

        <p>
            I also currently reflect about how to properly do both backend and frontend.
            In the end, ill used this what ive learned currently for our future activities,
            projects and more and also learn more in this subject regarding full stack.
